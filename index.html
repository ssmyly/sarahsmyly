                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Emory University, with research interests in health economics and Industrial Organization. My work particularly focuses on the intersection of these fields, where I explore structural health economics to understand the complexities of healthcare markets.</p>
                        <p>Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned a Bachelor of Science in Economics and a Bachelor of Arts in Music from Berry College. My academic journey at Berry was marked by a capstone project that I am now developing into a research paper, in collaboration with a former professor and his colleague.</p>
                        <p>During my undergraduate years, I gained valuable experience as a writing tutor at the Berry College Writing Center. I am honored to be a recipient of the Laney Graduate School Fellowship at Emory University, which supports my commitment to advancing knowledge in economics. Outside of academia, I maintain a deep connection to music, performing as a pianist and trumpet player.</p>
