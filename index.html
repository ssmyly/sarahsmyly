                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Emory University, specializing in health economics and Industrial Organization. My research is focused on the intersection of these fields, particularly in structural health economics.</p>
                    <p>Before my doctoral studies, I earned a BS in Economics and a BA in Music from Berry College. My capstone project there is currently being developed into a research paper in collaboration with a former professor.</p>
                    <p>I also served as a writing tutor at Berry College, helping students at all stages of the writing process. I am honored to be a recipient of the Laney Graduate School Fellowship at Emory University, which supports my ongoing research. Outside of my academic work, I am an avid pianist and trumpet player.</p>
